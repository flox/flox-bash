#
# NOTE: this file is mastered in:
#       ${inputs.flox-floxpkgs}/lib/inspectBuild.nix
#
# ... but we cannot copy from that input at build time
# because that creates a cyclic dependency which causes
# flox to be rebuilt when floxpkgs changes, which causes
# a publish of the built flox package back to floxpkgs,
# and then the cycle continues. Until we find a better
# way to prevent this (probably by putting the catalog
# data on a different branch) we'll just have to keep these
# files in sync by hand - hopefully they won't change often.
