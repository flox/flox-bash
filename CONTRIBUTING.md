# Contributing

We welcome bug fixes for this project.

This repository is being migrated and ported to lower level languages in the
repository [flox](https://github.com/flox/flox).
With that in mind we want to avoid adding extensions to `flox` written
in `bash`.

However, if you find a bug, a mistake in any inline documentation or manuals,
or other changes aside from new feature extensions - we'd be more than happy to
review them.

Thanks!
